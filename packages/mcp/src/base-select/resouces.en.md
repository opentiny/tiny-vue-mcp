# BaseSelect Component

BaseSelect is the basic version of the Select component, which is the same as the Select component, but does not include the drop-down tree and drop-down table functions. The package volume of the BaseSelect component is smaller, if you do not need the drop-down tree and drop-down table functions, it is recommended to use the BaseSelect component, rather than the Select component.
